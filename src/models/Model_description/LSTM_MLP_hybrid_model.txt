Objectives:
 -predict crime trends over future time periods
 -identify which crime is most likely to occur
 -identify crime timestamps for sequence modeling
 -identify all static features
 -Regression output for forecasting trends
 -Classification output for predicitng the most frequent crime type

Data cleaning and pre-processing:
 -Imputed missing numerical values (e.g., age) using median or mean imputation.
 -Using a column transformer to handle preprocessing for numerical and categorical data together by means of a pipeline where instead of processing each subset of features separately and then concatenating the results manually, 
  the column transformer will define all transformations in one step, ensuring that transformations were applide consistently during both training and inference.
 -Embedding layers were used
